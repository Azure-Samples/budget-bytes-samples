## Content Development Process

This series follows a structured content development process with three touchpoint meetings for each speaker to ensure consistency and quality:

1. **Initial Planning** - Content outline and technical requirements
2. **Content Review** - Demo validation and narrative alignment  
3. **Final Review** - Polish and integration testing

Content lead Pablo Lopes (.NET Advocacy team) coordinates across sessions to maintain consistency and leverage existing demo applications where possible.
